-Short Term TODO-

Improve Minimax
Figure Out how to cross compile
CheckersGameState should be broken up into an 8x8 grid GameState for Chess/Checkers, or gridded game in general
Hearts should be abstracted for code reuse for other Trick based games
Consider Creating a superclass that would encompase all grid board games (Chess,Checkers,TicTacToe, potentially more)
Make CLI more powerful (undo, step through computer played game)
Unify when it is printed when test failed
Finish Hearts AI
Look into using QObject::delteLater() instead of "delete qObject" 
PieceBasedGameState shouldn't refresh the background when renderPieces is called which causes flickering


- Know Bugs -
On Android it will not update the winner between games
Piecebasedgamestate doesn't handle event->size vs scene->width as well as it should
CheckersGameState should force you to capture when you have the opportunity but it does not


- Long Term TODO -
Add difficulty
