-Short Term TODO-

Improve Minimax
Figure Out how to cross compile
CheckersGameState should be broken up into an 8x8 grid GameState for Chess/Checkers, or gridded game in general
Hearts should be abstracted for code reuse for other Trick based games
Consider Creating a superclass that would encompase all grid board games (Chess,Checkers,TicTacToe, potentially more)
Make CLI more powerful (undo, step through computer played game)
Unify when it is printed when test failed
Finish Hearts AI
